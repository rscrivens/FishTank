# FishTank
This project was made for my final project for the inaugural Motoko Bootcamp in 2022.

I made a place where users can see their NFT fishes happily swimming inside of the users own personal fish tank. The site features a random userâ€™s fish tank on the front page and you can cycle to the next randomly featured fish tank from the community.

## Features
- On mint each fish has 3 colors that are randomly generated from a pool of 20 different colors and are applied to the fish to help make each one unique.
- Login with your Plug account to view your own fish tank and mint new fishes for in your tank.
- Fishes can be clicked to enlarge for easier viewing without disturbing the other fishes.
- Fishes swim at different speeds and will turn around when they hit the edge of the tank.
