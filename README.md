# Fish Tank
I made a place on the Internet Computer where NFT fish can happily swim around their owners fish tank. The front page features a random fish tank from the community and you can cycle to the next randomly featured fish tank. After logging in you can customize your own Fish Tank.

This project was initially made for my final project for the inaugural Motoko Bootcamp in 2022. And then Redesigned and improved for the Supernova 2022 Hackathon.

## Features
- First time you logon you get a Golden Fish airdropped to your tank. This fish can be tradded in for a free fish for your tank. Any fish you receive from Golden fish are Soul Bound and can't be tradded or donated.
- On mint each fish has 4 colors, body size and speed variations that are randomly selected, and help make each one unique.
- Logging in is done via Internet Identity
- Fish can be clicked to enlarge for easier viewing and their stats are displayed (without disturbing the other fish).
- Fish will turn around when they hit the edge of the tank.
- Fish can be donated to recieve a randomly selected Hat accessory unlocks
- Hat accessory unlocks can be used to permenatly unlock a hat for a specific fish.
- Hats can be put on fish that have them unlocked
- Fish can selectily be added to the Display tank(the public facing tank)

## Deployed canister
The current deployment is on a testnet canister that will be used for testing, and accounts/fish will be reset if needed. Minting is free on the testnet:
