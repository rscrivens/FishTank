# Fish Tank
This project was made for my final project for the inaugural Motoko Bootcamp in 2022.

I made a place where NFT fish can happily swim around their owners own personal fish tank. The site features a random userâ€™s fish tank on the front page and you can cycle to the next randomly featured fish tank pulled from the community.

## Features
- On mint each fish has 3 colors that are randomly generated from a pool of 20 different colors and are applied to the fish to help make each one unique.
- Login with your Plug account to view your own collection and mint new fish for your tank.
- Fish can be clicked to enlarge for easier viewing without disturbing the other fish.
- Fish swim at different speeds and will turn around when they hit the edge of the tank.
- Each tank has it own randomly generated gravel color on the tank's floor.
